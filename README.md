# CCLab
 
here is my website https://github.com/chrisleellf/CCLab_Chris 
and this is the live version of it on GitHub Peages

This is the root, or very base of my cclab folder. 

if you see this on a url that looks like 

chrisleellf.github.io/repo-name

then you can append project/website/folder names to the url to get to the actual webpages.
